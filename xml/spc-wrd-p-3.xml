      <p>How can you study well? I think you should have good study habits. Then you can spend less <span>t<q><k>time</k></q></span> but learn <span>m<q><k>more</k></q></span>.</p>
      <p>First, make the <span>f<q><k>full</k></q></span> use of your time. Are your books open? If so, please <span>t<q><k>turn</k></q></span> off your TV and be <span>a<q><k>away</k></q></span> from your snacks. Of <span>c<q><k>course</k></q></span>, you need some time to play. But you should play <span>a<q><k>after</k></q></span> study. Remember: study <span>c<q><k>comes</k></q></span> first.</p>
      <p>Second, <span>l<q><k>listen</k></q></span> to your teachers carefully in your <span>c<q><k>class</k></q></span>. You know, it is very important. If you have questions, just <span>a<q><k>ask</k></q></span> your teachers, thay are very glad to <span>h<q><k>help</k></q></span> you.</p>
      <p><span>T<q><k>Third</k></q></span>, do your homework by <span>y<q><k>yourself</k></q></span>. Maybe you can't work <span>o<q><k>out</k></q></span> a problem. You can ask for help. But you can't just copy the <span>a<q><k>answer</k></q></span>. Make sure you understand it.</p>
      <p>Fourth, <span>t<q><k>take</k></q></span> a notebook with you. Sometimes you may jave some <span>i<q><k>ideas</k></q></span> of questions. Please write them <span>d<q><k>down</k></q></span>. Then you can talk <span>t<q><k>to</k></q></span> your teachers, parents or <span>f<q><k>friends</k></q></span>.</p>
      <p>These <span>f<q><k>four</k></q></span> tips are helpful to you. <span>P<q><k>Please</k></q></span> have a <span>t<q><k>try</k></q></span>! You may <span>s<q><k>succeed</k></q></span> if you have good study <span>h<q><k>habits</k></q></span>.</p>

      <p>Reading is an activity people enjoy a lot in their free time.</p>
      <p>Some like reading newspapers and <span>o<q><k>others</k></q></span> enjoy novels or comic books. My <span>f<q><k>favorate</k></q></span> books are those <span>t<q><k>those</k></q></span> about the lives of great people. Reading them <span>a<q><k>always</k></q></span> gives <span>m<q><k>me</k></q></span> a lot of ideas on how to make my <span>o<q><k>own</k></q></span> life better.</p>
      <p>Great people are remembered not because they were handsome or beautiful, <span>b<q><k>but</k></q></span> because they did not give up <span>w<q><k>when</k></q></span> their lives were difficult. Yhey rried to use <span>e<q><k>every</k></q></span> chance to change their <span>l<q><k>lives</k></q></span> and make the world <span>b<q><k>better</k></q></span>.</p>
      <p>One good <span>e<q><k>example</k></q></span> is Orville and Vilbur Wright, the two brothers <span>w<q><k>who</k></q></span> invented the airplane. The plane has <span>m<q><k>made</k></q></span> the world <span>i<q><k>into</k></q></span> a small village. Hard work, not good luck, is the <span>r<q><k>reason</k></q></span> why the Wright Brothers could invent this convenient machine and become <span>g<q><k>great</k></q></span> people. Today we will remember them when we see planes <span>i<q><k>in</k></q></span> the <span>s<q><k>sky</k></q></span>.</p>
      <p>Whenever I read <span>s<q><k>stories</k></q></span> about great people, I always learn a lot <span>f<q><k>from</k></q></span> encourage me to march on(前进，进步).</p>
      <p>This is why I enjoy reading <span>a<q><k>about</k></q></span> great people's lives.</p>
