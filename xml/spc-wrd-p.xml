      Sarah is a pretty English girl with long h<span><q><k>hair</k></q></span>. She l<span><q><k>loves</k></q></span> China v<span><q><k>very</k></q></span> much. She is t<span><q><k>teaching</k></q></span> herself C<span><q><k>Chinese</k></q></span> now, b<span><q><k>because</k></q></span> she will s<span><q><k>study</k></q></span> in Peking University next year. She is often told something a<span><q><k>about</k></q></span> China . She f<span><q><k>feels</k></q></span> very pleased whenever she learns the development in C<span><q><k>China</k></q></span>. At the a<span><q><k>age</k></q></span> of 10, Sarah saw a panda in the z<span><q><k>zoo</k></q></span> from China. That was the first t<span><q><k>time</k></q></span> she got to k<span><q><k>know</k></q></span> something about China. Since then she has been interested i<span><q><k>in</k></q></span> all about China. She practices s<span><q><k>speaking</k></q></span> Chinese every day. And she keeps on w<span><q><k>watching</k></q></span> CCTV on w<span><q><k>weekends</k></q></span>. She often s<span><q><k>says</k></q></span> to herself, "I must study Chinese h<span><q><k>hard</k></q></span>."
